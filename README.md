# 😽 This is "Eva"

Eva is my personal discord bot, created as a fun little passion project to learn JavaScript. i designed it to do a bunch of things and then some. i don't really know where to go from this since I do not plan on releasing it to the public as a General Purpose Bot, both because i cannot be arsed with the pressure and i would literally become buzz lightyear in that one store scene so instead I'm throwing the code onto here because ***WE FUCKING LOVE FOSS RRAAAAHHHH***

-ahem- 

check out the following👇

## Features

### 🛠️ Moderation
- Eva can help with moderation tasks like banning, kicking, muting, and more
- it can also track deleted and edited messages in the server, so you never miss a change

### 🎲 Fun Commands
- for those endless DnD nights Eva has a ?roll command that you can use to roll with advantage. I promise I did not rig it...
- there’s always room for more commands, so I’m planning to keep adding more as I go.

## To-Do list

### 🛡️ Error Handling
- i still need to implement this properly. While some commands do return console logs, I really want to make an error handler instead.
- i need to work up more ideas ooaaghhh... -w-
